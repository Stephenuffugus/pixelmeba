# DECISIONS — running log of judgment calls made during implementation

Append‑only. One entry per decision the canonical docs did not settle (or a concern about a
canonical rule you implemented anyway). Rulings made *before* implementation are in
`CONFLICT_REGISTER.md`; do not duplicate them here.

Format:
```
## D-#### · YYYY-MM-DD · <task id> · <short title>
Context: what the docs say / don't say.
Decision: what was done.
Reason: why, tied to the non‑negotiables (truthful, deterministic, conserved, understandable, emergent).
Affects: files / fixtures / versions bumped.
Owner review: yes|no (if yes, also listed in EXPANSION_RESPONSE.md §8)
```

## D-0001 · 2026-09-27 · baseline · Decision cadence adopted from Phase 0
Context: D01 implies per‑tick movement decisions; D05 §5 specifies a 0.5 s decision interval for
strategies (Ancestral = template controller). With one ruleset (R03), two cadences would mean two
code paths.
Decision: every self‑propelled organism decides direction every 0.5 s from Phase 0; passability is
rechecked every tick; predators re‑target on the same schedule and pursue every tick.
Reason: one controller path, fewer sensing evaluations, identical behavior once D05 lands.
Affects: SPEC §6.4; movement fixtures.
Owner review: no

## D-0002 · 2026-09-27 · baseline · Birth placement candidate order
Context: D01 says "select birth positions by deterministic priority" without naming it.
Decision: candidates = parent cell + 8 neighbors filtered by compatibility/passability/capacity;
ordered by crowding ascending, then a fixed neighbor index (E, S, W, N, NE, SE, SW, NW, center);
fungi rank by usable food then suitability per D01 §8.
Reason: deterministic, favors space, no randomness needed.
Affects: SPEC §6.9; blocked‑division fixture.
Owner review: no

## D-0003 · 2026-09-27 · baseline · Sensing locus rounding
Context: D03 multiplies an integer radius by a continuous factor and clamps 1–6.
Decision: `round(r × (0.5 + g))` then clamp 1–6; at g = 0.5 this equals the native radius for
all templates, satisfying C07.
Reason: cells are discrete; neutral founder equivalence preserved.
Affects: SPEC §8.2; neutral‑founders fixture.
Owner review: no

## D-0004 · 2026-09-27 · P0.6 · Death-cause attribution window
Context: SPEC §12.2 attributes the primary cause to "the largest health-loss contributor over the final 10 s". A literal 10-second window needs a per-entity ring of damage samples.
Decision: per-source damage accumulators decay by e^(−dt/10) each tick (a 10 s time constant); the largest accumulator at death is the primary cause, and sources ≥ 25 % of it are concurrent contributors. Age, predation, lysis and sampling remain definitive causes.
Reason: equivalent intent with 4 floats per organism instead of a ring buffer; deterministic.
Affects: src/sim/maintenance.ts.
Owner review: no

## D-0005 · 2026-09-27 · P0.8 · FIRST_DISH_V1 Sunbead radius 4 → 5
Context: D06 §6 places 12 A01 "within radius 4 of (48,48)", but (48,48) lies inside the Water Garden stone disk at (42,45) r 9. Only 10 water cells exist within radius 4, so the recipe as written cannot be realized.
Decision: FIRST_DISH_V1 uses radius 5 for the A01 founders. Because founders take the nearest valid cells (distance, then y, then x), the 12 chosen cells are identical for every radius ≥ 4.5; radius 5 is the smallest integer that fits. The recipe keeps its ID because the original was never realizable, so no prior behavior exists to preserve. The realizer never silently widens a radius: an unrealizable recipe is an error.
Reason: smallest change that realizes the documented intent; placement stays exact and reviewable.
Affects: content/recipes/FIRST_DISH_V1.json, docs/CONTENT_TABLES.md §9.1.
Owner review: no (disclosed in EXPANSION_RESPONSE §3)

## D-0006 · 2026-09-27 · P0.2 · Attached species list water as a habitat
Context: CT §1.3 gives attached species (B02, B13, F01–F04, P06) only attachment surfaces. Mesh, beads and stone edges also occur in water cells.
Decision: their `habitats` include every substrate a valid surface can sit on (B02, B13, F01, F02, F04: water/gel/sediment; F03: water/sediment; P06: water), while `attachment.surfaces` restricts where they may actually live. From Phase 3, `canOccupy` must require a listed attachment surface in the cell for attached species (gel/sediment substrate, stone edge, bead, or mesh), so plain open water stays off-limits.
Reason: mesh (S06) and beads are useless to fungi otherwise; the surface list remains the real constraint.
Affects: content/species/*.json; Phase 3 task P3.3 must implement the surface check.
Owner review: no

## D-0007 · 2026-09-27 · P0.2 · Siltworm habitat and water crossing
Context: CT §1.3 says P04 lives in "sediment (+ ≤ 2 water cells)".
Decision: P04 `habitats` is ["sediment"]; the SEDIMENT_WATER_CROSSING ability (Phase 3) makes up to two consecutive water cells passable and treats them as habitat-compatible while crossing, so the worm is not damaged mid-crossing. P04 moisture tolerance is [0.4, 1] (a sediment consumer, not a water consumer).
Reason: keeps habitat semantics simple and puts the special rule where it belongs.
Affects: content/species/P04.json; P3.4.
Owner review: no

## D-0008 · 2026-09-27 · P0.2 · Film halves total inhibitor exposure once
Context: SPEC §7.1 mentions film halving the bacterial inhibitor; CT §3.4 and SPEC §4.3 say film halves total exposure once.
Decision: film halves the organism's combined effective exposure (all targeting inhibitors + RIVAL term) once. Material guide texts say so.
Reason: CT §3.4 and SPEC §4.3 are the more specific statements; D02 §5 confirms "Biofilm halves the combined exposure once".
Affects: src/sim/suitability.ts; content/materials/INH_*.json, M08.json.
Owner review: no
